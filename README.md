# Ormuco Question 3 LRU Caching
At Ormuco, we want to optimize every bits of software we write. Your goal is to write a new
library that can be integrated to the Ormuco stack. Dealing with network issues everyday,
latency is our biggest problem. Thus, your challenge is to write a new Geo Distributed LRU (Least
Recently Used) cache with time expiration.
### This is missing the geo distributed cache functionality
## This is not published as an NPM package yet. 
## To run the file: Clone the repo and run 'node testCode.js'
## Edit testCode.js to add more testing Cases
