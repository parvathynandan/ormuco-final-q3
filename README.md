# Ormuco Question 3 LRU Caching
At Ormuco, we want to optimize every bits of software we write. Your goal is to write a new
library that can be integrated to the Ormuco stack. Dealing with network issues everyday,
latency is our biggest problem. Thus, your challenge is to write a new Geo Distributed LRU (Least
Recently Used) cache with time expiration.
